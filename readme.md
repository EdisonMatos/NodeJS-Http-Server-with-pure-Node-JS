# Backend Project: A HTTP Server with nodeJS

In this simple project we create a basic web http server using nodeJS, where you can acess 2 routes ("/" and "/users").

### Skills applied in this project:

- Package manager: NPM
- Language: Javascript
- Modules: nodemon

### How to test it?

First of all, you need to clone this repository to your pc. Lets do it step by step:

- Download GitBash from: https://git-scm.com/downloads
- Then, after install it, open the git bash command line editor and type:

> $ git init

(it will start a git repository on your folder). Now, lets clone it.

> $ git clone https://github.com/EdisonMatos/NodeJS-Http-server.git

And its done, you have clonned my repository.

---

Now, to run the server open your command line editor in the root of the fold and run:

> npm install

(it will download any npm modules necessary. In this case, we are using Nodemon, for example.)

And now you are good to go. To test the server runing, run:

> npm run start:dev

And its done.
